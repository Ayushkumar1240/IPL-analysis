In this project we are going to perform the data anlaytics on IPL data.
We will be creating a dashboard to show the data that user wants like who won the title in a particular season, who won the purple cap, orange cap, number of sixes,fours etc.
The user will be able to choose the season by his choice.
Also we will be genarating the list of runs scored by a batsman and wicket taken by the bowler in a particuar season and hs overall performance.
Here also the user will be able to control the system in the way he wants.

All the things are done in Tableau
